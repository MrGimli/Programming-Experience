# Introduction
I am Zachary Goodman, computer and data science intern at Bowling Green State University. This repository is a collection of my programs and assignments related to computer science and information technology. Please see the "Important" folder for a comprehensive collection of my best programs, but feel free to browse my other folders as further evidence of my experience in the field.

// Program #1 â€“ Hurricane Program
// Programmer:  Zachary Goodman 1001
// Class:  CS 2020, SP 2022
// Due Date: Feb 7, 2022
// Purpose of program: Intake information from an outside file, sort the file by name, and output the information organized. It then also outputs which cities have iolent winds or major floods, as well as the city with the highest winds. 

//all the libraries needed for this program to function
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <fstream>
#include <iomanip>
